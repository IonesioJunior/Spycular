    "## Introduction üìú\n",
    "The MNIST Dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a collection of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is a 28x28-pixel square, and the dataset is split into a training set and a test set. MNIST is commonly used for image classification tasks, especially for training and evaluating algorithms in the field of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals üéØ\n",
    "The primary goals of the MNIST Dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Digit Recognition** üîç: Enable researchers and machine learning practitioners to develop and evaluate algorithms that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Benchmarking Algorithms** ‚öñÔ∏è: Serve as a standard benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of various image classification algorithms, particularly neural networks and deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Educational Purposes** üìö: Provide a beginner-friendly dataset for learning and understanding the fundamentals of image processing and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table Example üìã\n",
    "As MNIST is primarily a collection of images, the tabular representation would typically consist of metadata related to the dataset. Here's a sample table with some metadata:\n",

    "## Contributors üë•\n",
    "The MNIST Dataset has been made publicly available and maintained by various contributors and researchers. It originated from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and was later modified by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges for use in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The efforts of these contributors have made the MNIST Dataset an essential resource for the machine learning community, enabling advancements in image classification and deep learning research.\n",
